We race not 1 but 6 races for the Children of Make a Wish\.   Drivers/Teams can choose whether they will participate in 6 races or just our main Wishful event on May 18th\.   Last 2 years we \( drivers, supporters and donators \) collected more than 3500 euro for Make a Wish Belgium\-Vlaanderen\. We already made several children happy with our support and that’s the reason why we make this an XXL version\. We will have fun during the races in our hobby but we know that we will also make those children happy with the wish they have\. On our discord and facebook page you will find some previous wishes that we have been able to realize with our support to Make a Wish Belgium \- Vlaanderen   Hope to see you on track and we thank you in advance on behalf of the Make a Wish children\. |
