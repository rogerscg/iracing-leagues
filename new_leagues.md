The launch of YesterYear Racing will take place in March 2024 and include only one series\. The inaugural series will be based on the 1990 NASCAR Whelen Modified and S\.M\.A\.R\.T\. Modified seasons\. Races will take place on Tuesday evenings at 9:00pm EST after a 55\-minute practice session and a 5\-minute qualifying session\. The first race will be held on March 12, 2024, followed by 14 races throughout the calendar year 2024\.
