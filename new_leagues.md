|[iRacing Cup Series 2026](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=13992){:target="_blank"} |[Discord](https://discord.gg/rEcKPq2D.){:target="_blank"} |Race times would be around 7:30 PM PST on Thursday nights\. We will be using fixed setups, and we will focus on clean and competitive racing\. People who are causing incidents that are reviewed after the races will be given penalty points\. Each caused incident will result in 2 penalty points given if it is decided it was an avoidable incident\. If you reach 6 points within 2 weeks then you will receive a spot penalty\. This means you will have to start from the rear of the field for the next scheduled race\. If you acquire 8 penalty points, you will be suspended for 1 race weekend\. I will be keeping track of points\. Race win will be awarded 55 points, 2nd place awarded 35 points, and each place after that will earn one point less than the person in front of them\. Based off feedback we will be doing full season points with no playoff, or a 10 race chase format for the top 10 in points for the season\. We will decide on this later\. I have a discord server Ill invite when you join\. |
