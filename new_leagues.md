|[Drunk Driver Carnage Therapy](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=10248){:target="_blank"} | |Get drunk, and drive really fast cars at very high speeds on really twisty roads\. So you're too drunk to race? Not here\! See how bad you \*\*\* driving when you're hammered, and cause no harm or damage\. Drive any car you own\. Will this stop you from driving drunk IRL? IDK, maybe\. You think you are a great driver when you can't even walk? Here's your chance to prove it\. I got this idea trying to drive a GT3 BMW M4 @ Road Atlanta\. I could not make it through the first chicanes, and I did not think I was that drunk\. I am willing to pony up $10 bucks US, hard earned bucks to make it happen and If just 1 person sees the light, it's a win\.\.\.and it will be pretty fun and funny too\! |
