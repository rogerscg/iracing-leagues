|[Chicken Dinner](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=13699){:target="_blank"} | |Chicken Dinner Street Stock Series is a competitive iRacing league built around the thrill of winning, just like hearing “Winner Winner Chicken Dinner” at the casino\. Designed to reward commitment without forcing participation, the series features an optional pay\-to\-play format that puts drivers in control\. Each week, competitors may choose to enter the Chicken Dinner pool for $2\. Every paid entry earns a raffle ticket toward end\-of\-season prizes, while drivers who opt out can still race with no penalty, just without ticket eligibility\. The more races a driver enters, the more tickets they accumulate and the better their odds\. At season’s end, drivers can strategically allocate their tickets however they choose, stacking them all on one prize or spreading them across multiple\. The season will span 30 races across 15 tracks, combining hard\-nosed Street Stock racing with a fun, fair, and transparent rewards system that keeps every race meaningful\. |
