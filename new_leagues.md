|[CCR](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=9885){:target="_blank"} | |Welcome to CCR, we are an iracing league that races primarily every Friday night with the Arca cars\. We are an open set\-up group but we will provide setups and the winner has to give up their winning set\. The focus of this league is not to be the fastest but to have the best racing possible\. We run a 3\-strike policy where if you hit someone 3 times in a race you must park it and it is on the drivers to admit if they caused the wreck\. The utmost importance is personal responsibility and the integrity of drivers\. Before joining, if you think the wreck is never your fault, love to blame others, or wrecking someone on the last lap is OK, this league is not correct for you, so take your lack of brain cells somewhere else\. If you are a clean driver and are respectful, this is the spot to race, please register and we will get you set up\. |

|[STEVE GOTTSCHALK MEMORIAL 91](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=9846){:target="_blank"} | |This past February, we lost an honest, kind and loving man, Steven Gottschalk\. Steve enjoyed racing with all of you, from many leagues including PRO, AOLL, RSR, AREA51, CORT and plenty more\. Steve started racing in the early nineties, from early on in the original NASCAR Racing game all the way up to iRacing\. He raced the same car with 'Nerf' as the sponsor which became an easy nickname that many people heard or remember\.   Steve was always thoughtful, caring and supportive which is why we decided to do a fundraising event, The Steve Gottschalk Memorial 91 on June 21st, 2023\. The virtual race is at North Wilkesboro in the Tour Modified\. To enter, fill out the form below and donate any amount, small or large, to The Lymelight Foundation\. The Lymelight Foundation provides grants to children and young adults with Lyme disease to receive proper  treatment and medication as well as raising awareness about Lyme disease\. |
