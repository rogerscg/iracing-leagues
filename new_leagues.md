|[ASCAR \(Anglo\-American Stock Car Racing\)](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=10760){:target="_blank"} | |ASCAR was a stock car racing series that raced at circuits around the United Kingdom and Europe from 2001 until 2008\. The series went through many guises during its seven year period and was known as the ASCAR Mintex Cup from 2001 to 2003, later known as the Days of Thunder Racing Series \(2004\) and the SCSA \(Stock Car Speed Association\) \(2005 to 2007\) before its final season as the SCSA MAC Tools VSR V8 Trophy\. Although going through these varying identities the series was commonly referred to and known by its original name of ASCAR\. The series predominantly raced the oval tracks at the Rockingham Motor Speedway and the EuroSpeedway Lausitz in the early years but in its final season in 2008 was solely road racing series that would visit various tracks in the UK most notably Brands Hatch and in France at Croix en Ternois\. The series folded in 2008 and merged into part of the European Late Model Series in 2009, racing in Belgium and the UK\. |
