|[Driverz Cup Formula Vee](https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/LeagueView.do?league=10890){:target="_blank"} | |Welcome to the Driverz Cup Formula Vee iRacing League\. ¬†This league was started by a group of us that race Formula Vee in "real life" across the eastern half of the United States either in Driverz Cup \(Southeast\), Challenge Cup \(Northeast\), or the SCCA\.¬† Here you will race against drivers with decades of racing experience in Formula Vee\. ¬†You will race wheel to wheel with current and former SCCA Runoffs winners, Runoffs podium finishers, Driverz Cup Champions, SCCA Conference Champions, and many more\.¬†¬†  The introduction of Yokohama radial tires to Formula Vee racing in Driverz Cup and Challenge Cup has created massive growth in the number of these race cars coming to the track\.¬† Their excellent performance, low cost, and durability to last a whole season or more has made racing these cars much more affordable for amateur racers\.¬† Hopefully this iRacing league can introduce more people to this fast growing class of race cars and provide information and connections to those interested\. |
