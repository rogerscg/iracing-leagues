Welcome to the iRacing League Directory! This is updated weekly to make finding a league that fits your needs more
easily. It's a simple UI, but it should be easy to navigate.

Find a league that interests you by going to any of the pages below based on car type, location, or just scroll through
the hundreds of active leagues in the directory. The directory also contains things such as the number of active drivers
in a season, the average strength of field, and any upcoming races the league has scheduled.

Got any questions? Feel free to message the creator on GitHub, iRacing, or Reddit.
